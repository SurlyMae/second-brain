_**Let's build a thing, shall we?**_

I am building a home-buying app.  

Here's the deal: I've bought a few homes in my lifetime and it's been a giant fucking hassle. First I'm emailing the realtor to become a client and get a lender recommendation. Then the realtor's emailing me docs to sign and advice and tips on home-buying. Then I'm emailing the lender to become a client and fill out an application. Then the lender is emailing back with followup questions and loan status. Then once I'm approved, I'm emailing the realtor back to tell them I'm approved and let's start looking at houses. I send my criteria. The realtor sends back houses which don't meet my criteria. I send my criteria again. The realtor sends back houses, and among them there are hard nos and a few possibilities, and now I need to work with the realtor to schedule in-person showings of the possibilities, and then once I see those houses I need to let the realtor know how I feel about those houses and what I want to do next, and on and on and on. This was all fine 10 years ago, when I last bought a house - but now it's 2023 and I'm a month into buying a home and AGAIN it's just the same. So much inefficiency, overly manual, really a complete drag. There is no reason buying a home needs to be such a damn drag.

So, I'm working on fixing that. I've got a long way to go but I can totally do it and so I will.
