I'd convinced myself that life was predictable. Grow up, get a career, get a family, age, buy a house, retire, grow ill, die. And because I thought these things were guaranteed to happen, I spent a lifetime trying to control their outcome. Trying to spot all hazards, every chess move, any possible disaster, then trying to outsmart, outengineer, outmanipulate the dangers in order to minimize their impact on the guaranteed.

Lol. Then I realized nothing is guaranteed. Not even basic health, housing, medical care, civil rights. Wild, right?

Kind of freeing, though. Once I understood I couldn't predict what might happen next, I also understood there was zero use in worrying and fretting and planning. Why stress about not having enough money to retire if you don't know you'll actually get to retire anyway? Why worry if the house you're about to buy isn't perfect, when any day it could be destroyed by an earthquake, a wildfire, a windstorm, you name it? Why try to shore up all your defenses against what might happen when LITERALLY ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANYTIME? An exhausting and endless task. I can't do it anymore. 

These days, I'm less, "What if we do this thing and it doesn't go as planned and ends badly?" and more, "Fuck it, let's try it and see what happens?"
