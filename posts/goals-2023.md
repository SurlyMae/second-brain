## 2022:

Last year, I:
  - gave up on the dream of working for myself (at least for now). Thinking about this possible future life was causing a lot of discontent with my actual life, and that was unacceptable because my actual life is pretty damn wonderful.
  - fell in love with rowing on the Great Salt Lake (GSL). What a magical place. I'd never even been there despite living in Salt Lake for the last 15 years, but in spring I was out there 2-3 times a week, rowing my [Echo shell](https://www.echorowing.com/echo-classic-product-info-page). A fabulous time in my life. But then the lake started drying up; our Utah politicians seem keen to let it die. I'm grateful I experienced the GSL while it was here. :( 
  - started camping. It's surprising that we weren't a camping family before, since camping is a very popular Utah religion. I love being out in nature and adore the quiet. I do not enjoy the bathroom situation.
  - [My LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014627905280364544/) sums up my 2022 work life fairly well.


## 2023:

This year, I'll:
- strengthen my body through lifting weights. My most important goals this year require a strong body, so this is priority.
- spend the spring rowing
- spend the summer finding and moving into a bigger house (omg can't wait)
- spend the fall rowing and learning to ride a horse!
- find joy in my work in a way I haven't before

Naturally, life will have to keep going well in order for these things to happen. And life never goes as planned, lol.
