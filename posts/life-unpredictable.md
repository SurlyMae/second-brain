I'd convinced myself that life was predictable. Grow up, get a career, get a family, age, buy a house, retire, grow ill, die. And because I thought these things were guaranteed to happen, I spent a lifetime trying to control their outcome. Trying to spot all hazards, every chess move, any possible disaster, then trying to outsmart, outengineer, outmanipulate the dangers in order to minimize their impact on the guaranteed.

Lol. Then I realized nothing is guaranteed. Not even basic health, housing, medical care, civil rights. Wild, right? The fact that it's taken me decades to realize this hasn't made me feel very clever.

This epiphany has been kind of freeing, though. Once I understood I couldn't predict what might happen next, I also understood there was zero use in worrying and fretting and planning at the level I am prone to. Why stress about not having enough money to retire if I don't know I'll actually get to retire in the first place? Why worry if the house we're about to buy isn't perfect, when any day it could be destroyed by an earthquake or a wildfire, or end up shrouded with toxic dust clouds from the dead Great Salt Lake? Why try to shore up all of my defenses against what might happen when LITERALLY ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANYTIME? An exhausting and endless task. I can't do it anymore. 

These days, I'm less, "What if we do this thing and it doesn't go as planned and ends badly?" and more, "Fuck it, let's try it and see what happens."
