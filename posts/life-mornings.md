It's a Friday, 7am. 12 degrees out, brr. D and I have been up for over an hour and we eagerly await the sunrise. 

We sit at our desks in our separate offices, drinking our breakfasts, and we read the news, we cruise the social media, we check our work slacks and teams and emails and calendars and holler to each other, "Did you see..?!" Our dog meanders back and forth between offices, first in one dogbed and then the other; I imagine him being conflicted about the different vibes in each room (D's office is bright, loud, and active, while mine is dark, quiet, and chill). 

Soon the meetings start, the all-handses and the standups and the syncs and the huddles. He meets with colleagues in Chicago and Portland and I meet with colleagues in Atlanta and Toronto. I shut our office doors and turn on noisemakers when D's discussions get too loud. Sometimes I lay on the floor and listen to meetings - without distracting visuals, it's easier for me to pay attention and stay engaged. 

Quite often one of us visits the other's office to talk about work. We're both software developers and we're either bouncing ideas off each other, getting help from each other, or bitching to each other. There's a lot of bitching and venting, honestly. Workplaces can be so aggravating, can't they? And trying to build something with the help of other teams of people? That can be frustrating work. 

Daily, we're shocked to discover it's 11am and not already 3pm.
